# Fake Shop Image Repository

This project is created as a part of Shopify's application process for Backend Developer Intern role starting Fall 2021. This shop allows an individual to spend upto $1000 buying a number of items available on the shop.
After each purchase, the wallet amount if deducted by the cost of the item. By this project, I am demonstrating the Buy functionality of the image repository.

Once the flask server has started, use the localhost link mentioned in the terminal to access the user Interface for this project. The link should look like - http://127.0.0.1:5000/ <br />

* Use the Buy button in the table to simulate buying different items. When you click buy, it will show a message confirmation, if the purchase was successful or not. 
* You can keep track of how much money if left for you to shop at the top of the home page.

## Future Improvements
